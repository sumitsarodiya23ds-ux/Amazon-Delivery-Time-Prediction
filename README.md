->Project Summary
-Problem Statement:-Build a machine learning system to predict delivery times for e-commerce orders based on factors like product size, distance,traffic,weather, and shipping method.

-Data Preparation:-Load,clean, and preprocess dataset.

-Data Cleaning:-Handle missing values,remove duplicates,standardize categorical data.

-EDA:-Explore trends,visualize traffic/weather impact, and analyze agent performance.

-Preprocessing:-perform encoding and standard scaling.

-Modeling:-Train models:
                        Linear Regression
                        Random Forest Regressor
                        Gradient Boosting Regressor
                        Evaluate with RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
                        Track with MLflow

-Deployment:-Deploy Streamlit app for accessibility.

-Results:-By project completion, A cleaned dataset.Multiple regression models (tracked in MLflow).Insights into delivery time factors.A functional Streamlit app for predictions.
